  <div id="About" class="container About">
    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <div class ="column">
      <p> ISPRESC members recognize that high quality policy research is the key to accomplishing this purpose. Government has legitimate interests in encouraging, supporting and regulating, the practice of school-based
         counseling to the extent to which it contributes to the public good. Government enacts laws and policies and creates institutions and agencies in order to promote its legitimate interests. Increasingly, school-based counseling
          is being seen as an influential mechanism to enhance students’ access to and engagement in the educational process. Similarly, it is being recognized as an essential component of education systems with strong links to equity in access,
          academic achievement, academic attainment, and successful transitions to work and higher education. Decision-makers in the public sector, however, need good information in order to know what to do and whether actions they take to promote
           school-based counseling are achieving their intended effects. Policy research provides educational decision-makers with information that supports effective action. </p>

      <p> ISPRESC members also recognize that while the need for high quality policy research related to school-based counseling is widely recognized around the world, the discipline of policy research in school-based counseling is still in its infancy.
         Furthermore, the developing field is hampered by the fact that few attempts have been made so far to look at policy issues and policy research from an international perspective because policy research has been referenced to specific national (or even subnational) contexts and issues. </p>

      <p> ISPRESC members also recognize that school-based counseling exists in many different forms around the globe. The delivery of preventive and/or remedial counseling services for students and caregivers/parents in schools is used to address a diverse set of societal issues including: poverty,
         threats to public health, violence, educational inequity, mental health, workforce development, and economic development. Diverse services are organized by several different implicit or explicit models and are delivered by individuals from diverse disciplinary backgrounds including: teaching,
          psychology, social work and professional counseling. </p>

      <p> ISPRESC is a democratic organization that operates by the consensus of its members and is committed to advancing the human rights of all children regardless of race, sexual orientation, class, nationality, ethnicity, age, disability, or spiritual/religious orientation.</p>

          <h4> Public Information </h4>
            <p>JSCPE is published on-line two times a year. All submitted articles should be original and must not be under consideration for publication elsewhere. Manucripts should follow
              closely the formatting style of the American Psychological Association (latest edition). JSCPE reviews manuscripts within approximately 30 working days of submission and publishes
              accepted articles in the relevant forthcoming issues upon receiving the final versions. </p>

          <h4> Review Process </h4>
            <p> Each manuscript will be first vetted to determine whether it is appropriate for the journal by the managing editor. If it is appropriate, the manuscript will be sent to a minimum
               of two blind reviewers for input and recommendations. Reviewers are allotted 30 days to return the manuscript to the editor with an overall disposition and thorough comments covering
                of the manuscript’s strengths and suggestions for enhancements. The journal editor will make the final disposition on the manuscript and will communicate with the author(s) through email.
                 Reviewers have these options for each manuscript they consider: (a) Accept manuscript with minor revisions, (b) Revise and resubmit, (c) Unacceptable, or (d) Not appropriate for journal (suggest other publishing venues). </p>

          <h4> Nondiscriminatory Statement </h4>
            <p>All manuscripts will be reviewed through a blind process and will be treated with all due dilligence to avoid conflict of interested and possible review bias. </p>
